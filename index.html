              ## What is Biometrics?

              * 'Biometrics' comes from the ancient Greek bios (life) and metron (measure)

              * It refers to measurable data that uniquely describes an individual's behavioural or physical traits

              ## Biometric Authentication Systems
              
              In a nutshell, biometric authentication systems are pattern recognition systems that can recognise highly distinctive patterns and associate them to a person. 

              Generally, it involves the "__enrolment__" process and the "__authentication__" process. The image goes here: 

              * Biometric Capture
              * Feature Extraction
              * Storage

						<h2>Disadvantages of biometrics</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>biometric measurements are unavoidably noisy</li>
              <li>sample collection process is influenced by environmental conditions</li>
              <li>lack of standardisation</li>
              <li>changes over time due to ageing, illness or injury</li>

				  	<h2>Verification</h2>
            <p>
              A user claims to be someone who needs to be veriﬁed and thus only an one-to-one comparison has to be performed by the biometric authentication system
            </p>
          </section>

				  <section>
				  	<h2>Identification</h2>
            <p>
              A user needs to be identiﬁed and therefore a one-to-many comparison has to be performed
            </p>

              Both have to be traded-off, as reducing FAR increases FRR and vice versa. 
              For example, if an authentication scheme tends to be tolerant with respect to accepting similar biometric data, the FAR of this system will be very high while the FRR would be satisfying.

            <p>
              Due to the fuzziness of the matching process of biometric authentication systems, there are two main types of errors:

              ## Generic Cryptosystems

              * In a public key cryptosystem, the following pair of keys are generated:
                * Public key 
                * Secret key
              * Public key will be used to encrypt a secret message

              * Not feasible to let users memorise their secret keys
              * Thus, 
                * Store the secret key in a smart card
                * Use a password to lock the secret key

              * The authentication procedure can simply be replaced through biometric authentication
              * Strengthen the already existing password by means of biometrics (2-factor authentication)
              * Biometric input can even be used directly to generate a cryptographic key or a biometric hash out of it.

              ## Key Release Scheme 

              * Cryptography keys and biometric data are independent of each other 
              * Biometric data is used to authenticate a user, if suceeded, then the key is released
              * Key could easily be modified, updated or replaced at any time in case it is compromised (cancellable)
              * Vulnerabilities:
                * Biometric matching process could be manipulated (or by-passed) by attackers
                * The cryptographic key has to be stored as part of the template

              ## Key Binding Scheme

              * Cryptographic key is directly derived from the user's biometric data 
              * Does not need to be stored anywhere
              * Vulnerabilities:
                * Could not be changed if it was compromised once
              * To achieve cancellable keys, it's common to combine the user's biometric data with the cryptographic key.
              * A more secure environment is provided by combining the key and the template  together, the key is intelligently mixed with the biometric data.
              * Single step

              ## Cancellable Biometrics

              * Unlike PINs or passwords, biometric characteristics are permanently associated with a person and cannot be change.
              * If biometric data is stolen (e.g., capturing images of iris or recording a person's voice) then the biometric data becomes useless and is lost forever

              Intermediate step has to be established, which adds secret information.
              * Commonly used approach is to apply transform functions the the biometric data
              * If a transformed sample of a person's biometrics is compromised only the transform function has to be changed.
